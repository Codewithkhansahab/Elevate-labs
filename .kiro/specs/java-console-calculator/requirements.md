# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a basic console-based calculator application in Java that allows users to perform arithmetic operations through command-line interaction. The calculator will support the four basic mathematical operations and provide a continuous interactive experience until the user chooses to exit.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform basic arithmetic calculations through a console interface, so that I can quickly compute mathematical operations without needing a GUI application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL display a welcome message and menu options
2. WHEN the user selects an operation THEN the system SHALL prompt for two numbers
3. WHEN valid numbers are entered THEN the system SHALL perform the calculation and display the result
4. WHEN the calculation is complete THEN the system SHALL return to the main menu

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform addition operations, so that I can calculate the sum of two numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects addition THEN the system SHALL prompt for two numeric inputs
2. WHEN two valid numbers are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate and display their sum
3. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the operation in format "a + b = result"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform subtraction operations, so that I can calculate the difference between two numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects subtraction THEN the system SHALL prompt for two numeric inputs
2. WHEN two valid numbers are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate and display their difference
3. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the operation in format "a - b = result"

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform multiplication operations, so that I can calculate the product of two numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects multiplication THEN the system SHALL prompt for two numeric inputs
2. WHEN two valid numbers are provided THEN the system SHALL calculate and display their product
3. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the operation in format "a * b = result"

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to perform division operations, so that I can calculate the quotient of two numbers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects division THEN the system SHALL prompt for two numeric inputs
2. WHEN two valid numbers are provided AND the divisor is not zero THEN the system SHALL calculate and display their quotient
3. WHEN the divisor is zero THEN the system SHALL display an error message "Cannot divide by zero"
4. WHEN the result is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the operation in format "a / b = result"

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to continue performing multiple calculations in a session, so that I can complete several operations without restarting the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a calculation is completed THEN the system SHALL ask if the user wants to perform another calculation
2. WHEN the user chooses to continue THEN the system SHALL return to the main menu
3. WHEN the user chooses to exit THEN the system SHALL display a goodbye message and terminate

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle invalid inputs gracefully, so that I can correct my mistakes without the application crashing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid numeric input is entered THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prompt again
2. WHEN an invalid menu option is selected THEN the system SHALL display an error message and show the menu again
3. WHEN any error occurs THEN the system SHALL NOT terminate unexpectedly
